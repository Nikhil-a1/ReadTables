# ReadTables
1) This library is used to genereate a table based on JSON data provided
2) Based on the property of a column header (i.e., if it is sortable or not) when we click on a column it is sorted
3) The JSON data to the table can be modified by replacing the value of state variable of data present in 'CreateTable.js' file
3) The filter property using input still need to be connected to the table
4) To run this library clone this repository and run "npm install" and you can see the libraries getting installed present in package.json
5) The other than "create-react-app", other libraries used are "react-redux", "react-bootstrap"
